# Hospital_Database_Management_System

The website is our project for the fifth Semester in engineering IT.

The website enables cluients to make their own accounts and get an appointment to doctors in a certain hypothetical Hospital. 
The patients can then keep track of their appointments and modify them as per their requirements.

The website is developed using-

-HTML and CSS for front end.
-javascript for front end scripting
-PHP for back end scripting
-MySQL for database management
